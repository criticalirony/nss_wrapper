NSS wrapper library
====================

This is a wrapper for the user, group and hosts NSS API allowing the use of
other data sources.

To be able to use it you need to set the following environment variables:

LD_PRELOAD=libnss_wrapper.so
NSS_WRAPPER_PASSWD=/path/to/your/passwd
NSS_WRAPPER_GROUP=/path/to/your/group

NSS_WRAPPER_HOSTS=/path/to/your/hosts

NSS_WRAPPER_HOSTNAME=test.example.org

You can either enable user and group resolving or only hosts. If you don't know
how the passwd file should look like, please read 'man 5 passwd', for the
groups file 'man 5 group' and for hosts 'man 5 hosts'.
